# Co-op Foundations: Grid
Styles for a simple but flexible grid system powered by CSS Flexbox.

## Legacy Grid system
To allow for projects to convert to the new grid system when they can. We have included the legacy grid system as a seperate CSS file. So you can still install this module as a dependency and include the legacy CSS file in your project instead of the new. When you are ready to migrate then you will just simply swap the file path to the new CSS grid system.

## How to use
1. Install via `npm` or Yarn:
  ```bash
  $ npm install @coopdigital/foundations-grid --save
  $ yarn add @coopdigital/foundations-grid
  ```
2. Add CSS module to your application via a most appropriate method. This will entirely depend on your application and how you are currently loading CSS modules within it.
